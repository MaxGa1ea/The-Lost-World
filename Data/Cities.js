The city of stormhold is based up the school of Stormhold, a magical school focused on controlling and manipulating Magical Energies.<br><br>The Site of stormhold was originally a castle known as Castle Toirneach (Castle Thunder), named after being on Mount Toirneach (Mountian of Thunder, an Auran Translation). This Castle was built to protect Several adamant mines in the region during the Magic Age, however when they ran dry the Castle was abandoned. Historians Generally Agree that This happened around 200-250 MA<br><br>During the Early 300’s MA an ancient Storm Sorcerer name Eratz Tintreach Found the Castle and set himself up there, calling the Castle the “Stormkeep”. Overtime people begin travelling to the castle to learn fro him as he was a very experienced Sorcerer who taught Sorcerer and Wizardkind alike. The Common term for travelling to Stormkeep became “Visiting the School of Stormhold”. As the School accepted this name it grew in students and teachers, and slowly merchant build trading posts, taverns, and housing around the Keep. This came to a Peak in 347 MA when Eratz decided to offically form the City of Stormhold and he was Unanimously elected as its Leader",
